## 📌 About the Project

**XC_VM** is a decrypted and modifiable version of the XtreamCodes panel — created for developers, hobbyists, and IPTV enthusiasts who need a transparent and self-hosted solution.

Why we built it:
- Existing solutions were obfuscated or unstable.
- We believe in **freedom, transparency, and open learning**.
- We wanted a solid base for further development — maintained by the community.
