## 📌 About the Project  

This project is based on **NeySlim 22F**, but with significant improvements. I have removed unnecessary `goto` statements and am actively refining the panel. My main goal is to provide a **working and freely modifiable** version, as I couldn't find a fully decrypted panel that was stable and fixable.  

### ⚠️ **Development Status**  
🚧 **This project is in early development.**  
I work on it in my free time, and as a **junior developer**, I am still learning PHP. As a result:  
- Some features **may not work** or function **incorrectly**.  
- The codebase **is constantly evolving** and improving.  

### ❗ Disclaimer  
I am **not responsible** for how this panel is used or the purposes it serves. Please ensure compliance with the legal regulations in your country before using it.  

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome! 🚀
