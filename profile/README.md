## About the project
I took the NeySlim 22F modification as a base, removed the goto and am now finalising the panel, as I have not found a decrypted panel that works and can be fixed freely. The panel is in an early stage of development. I am working on it in my spare time. This project can be classified as written for myself, I am a junior developer and do not know php well. At the moment some of the features may not work or may not work properly. I am not responsible for how the panel is used and for what purposes.
